 Hitler-style applicant welcomed by parties
 By Roger Boyes
 
 
 
 MANAGERS of Germany’s political parties are having difficulty explaining their
 enthusiastic reaction to a man who applied for membership with letters cribbed
 largely from Mein Kampf, Hitler’s personal manifesto. The incident illustrates
 how indiscriminate parties have become in taking on new members during an
 election campaign, even when their sentiments bear a suspicious resemblance to
 those of the Führer. 
 
 “Edmund Stoiber is a thousand times more suited to leading Germany than the
 present Chancellor,” said one letter sent to the Christian Social Union
 headquarters in Ingolstadt. “Chancellor Schröder is doing nothing to stop the
 flood of foreigners who are spreading around our Fatherland,” said the letter,
 signed by a certain Rudolph Lewald. 
 
 The CSU immediately spotted a potential member. “Many thanks for your nice
 thoughts,” replied the local party manager, who enclosed an application for
 membership. 
 
 The letter used chunks of Hitler’s book, which is still banned in Germany.
 History students have to apply for access to the book in university libraries.
 
 
 “The strongest, the brave and the hardworking will receive the birthright of
 existence, only those who are born weaklings could regard this as offensive,”
 the letter-writer said. “So-called humanity is melting like snow in the March
 sun.” Such phrases were lifted from Mein Kampf, which was written while Hitler
 was in jail after the failed Munich putsch of 1923. 
 
 Similar letters, also using the Nazi leader’s words, were sent to the other
 political parties and drew sympathetic responses. “I read your letter with
 great interest and pleasure,” the manager of the Christian Democratic Union in
 Cologne, said. 
 
 “Great that you want to join us!” enthused the Green Party headquarters. The
 Free Democrats invited the aspiring party member to a fundraising charity ball
 at which Hans- Dietrich Genscher, the former Foreign Minister, would be the
 star guest. The Social Democrats sent a list of rallies to be attended by
 Gerhard Schröder, the Chancellor. 
 
 “I wanted to test how serious parties are about combating right-wing
 extremism,” said the letter-writer, who was in fact the Cologne novelist
 Rainer Popp. “I had no idea that they would be so enthusiastic. 
 
 “For the first few days I expected two men in leather coats from the Special
 Branch to knock on my door. Instead only the postman called — with packets of
 election material from zealous political headquarters,” Herr Popp said. 
 
 “I was stunned that political parties could react in this way — I reckon I
 would have had the same response if I had signed the letter ‘Adolf Hitler’.”
