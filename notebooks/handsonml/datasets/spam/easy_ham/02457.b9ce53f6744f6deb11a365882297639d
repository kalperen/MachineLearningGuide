KASHIWA, Chiba -- A man has been arrested for using his camera-equipped
mobile phone to take a photo of the inside of a schoolgirl's skirt
as she rode an escalator here, police said.

Toyokazu Hamano, 40, a company employee from Noda, Chiba Prefecture,
was arrested for breaking a Chiba Prefectural Government law
forbidding people from creating a public nuisance.

Hamano admits to the allegations.

Police said Hamano was riding behind the girl on an escalator at
JR Kashiwa Station when he took out his mobile phone, held it
underneath the girl's skirt and took a photo. The girl was alerted
to his presence by the noise emitted by the phone camera's shutter.
She turned around to catch Hamano with his hands between her legs.
