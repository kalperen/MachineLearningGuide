[IMG: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/pictures/dhtml2d.jpg (Dynamic HTML, 2d 
Edition)][1]Ah! Danny Goodman has released the new version of Dynamic HTML[2]. 
It's been a few years since the first edition, which is _still_ the best 
reference on HTML despite being severely out of date. The new edition is 1400 
packed pages that actually tells you what web browsers that are actually in use 
actually do, which makes it invaluable. It has been brought up to date with all 
the latest browsers and the newest HTML specs. If you're working with HTML 
in any way, shape, or form, this book is an absolute requirement.
