Broadband's killer application — the one activity that dwarfs all others —
is online gaming, which 80 percent of South Koreans under 25 play, according
to one recent study. Critics say the burgeoning industry is creating
millions of zombified addicts who are turning on and tuning into computer
games, and dropping out of school and traditional group activities, becoming
uncommunicative and even violent because of the electronic games they play.

"Game players don't have normal social relationships anymore," said Kim Hyun
Soo, a 36-year-old psychiatrist who is chairman of the Net Addiction
Treatment Center, one of many groups that have sprung up to cope with
Internet game addiction. "Young people are losing the ability to relate to
others, except through games. People who become addicted are prone to
violence, even when they are not playing.
