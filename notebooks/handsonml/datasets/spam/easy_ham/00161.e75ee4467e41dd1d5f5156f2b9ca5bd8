Newspaper's readers complain over 'let's have sex' picture caption

Readers of an African newspaper have complained after a picture caption
about jewellery contained the words "let's have sex".
The mix-up highlights the problems caused by the wide range of languages
spoken in Namibia.
Callers to the Namibian were angered by the use of the word tulumweni, which
translates roughly as "let's have intercourse" in the Oshiwambo language.
It was used in a caption concerning people in the Caprivi who use rings from
the femidon - female condom - as jewellery.
According to the The Namibian , an activist involved in care for Aids/HIV
patients spelt the word tulumweni for the journalist.
He intended it to mean "you will see for yourselves" in the Siyeyi tongue.
One caller said the complainants "should be considerate of other people's
languages. It is very clear that the picture was taken in the Caprivi ...And
that the word is from Siyeyi. It is not Oshiwambo".
Others indicated that various words might have different meanings in various
Namibian languages, such as omakende, an Oshiwambo word for glasses which in
Siyeyi means testicles.
Another word with a double-meaning is tulikunde, which in Oshiwambo
translates as let's talk, but which in Sisubiya translates as let's have
intercourse.
The Herero word for a hat is ekoli, which is an Oshiwambo word for a vagina.
