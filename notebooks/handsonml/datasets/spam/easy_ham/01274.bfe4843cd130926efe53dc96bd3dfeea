I assume that you won't %ghost or remove these and the modules.conf
change on uninstall, though.  So people who are installing this RPM and
are unfortunate enough to have a DVD drive (or just an ordinary CD,
non-DVD drive) that doesn't support DMA will be left with a system
without a working CD drive, even after removing the RPM.  And without
ever knowing what struck them.  You can't remove the DMA setting from
modules.conf either unless you're sure that ogle added it there and
nothing else needs it.

The /dev stuff isn't that dangerous, but the modules.conf change can
be.  That's why "Eek" :)

A worthy goal...

How about splitting the creation of the symlinks and modules.conf
modifications into a separate RPM?
