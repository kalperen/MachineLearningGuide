Back when 64KB was more memory than any computer would ever need, there was a 
time when memory managers didn’t exist. But gradually, new computer systems 
came out with larger amounts of memory and designers discovered ways to eat up 
RAM faster than any system could dish it out. This discussion is based on 
Tiburon's experiences in writing and rewriting the memory manager for Madden 
NFL 97 to Madden NFL 2002.
