I love the absurd sense of humor it takes to build up such an elaborate 
evening only to note that "even if the date's a bust you can always have 
a hundred people up for cocktails" in your penthouse suite at the end of 
the night :-)

Personally, I'd put one point in favor of the Redwood Room over Lapis: 
on a weeknight, you can still whip out a TiBook and write, since it's a 
hotel bar. And it seems to give people all sorts of license to 
interrogate you as to why you're writing with a double of scotch :-)

Best,
   Rohit
