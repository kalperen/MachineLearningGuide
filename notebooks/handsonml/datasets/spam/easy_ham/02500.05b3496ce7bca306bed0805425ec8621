Hi,

I think you need to give us a little more detailed information.

You get _exactly_ the same problem with Suse and RedHat, is that right?
What versions of these have you used?

As in freezes, reboots?  Do you get any errors?

Did you disable it in the BIOS or in windows?

1. What laptop is it?  What is the Processor and how much RAM does it have?

2. You cannot simply boot off the cdrom?  It must be quite an old laptop
then or else cdrom booting is disabled in the BIOS.  Is the cdrom external
or strange in some way?
