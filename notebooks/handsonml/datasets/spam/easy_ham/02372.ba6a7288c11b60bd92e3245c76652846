After discovering an open wireless net available from his sofa, Steven 
"Hackers" Levy interviewed lawmen, academics and WiFi activists about the 
legality and ethics of using open wireless access points. 

    I downloaded my mail and checked media news on the Web. When I confessed 
    this to FBI agent Bill Shore, he spared the handcuffs. "The FBI wouldn't 
    waste resources on that," he sniffed. Now I know that if it did, it would 
    be hard to argue that I broke a law. What's more, I certainly didn't feel 
    illegal. Because—and this is the point of all that war-driving and 
    -chalking and node-stumbling—when you get used to wireless, the experience 
    feels more and more like a God-given right. One day we may breathe 
    bandwidth like oxygen—and arguing its illegality will be unthinkable.
