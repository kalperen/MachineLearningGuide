Well, I know a guy that split up from her that wrote Harry Potter.
Though he is doing fine.

I was offered a film part as a shot up gangster, but turned it down.
Seemed good to me, ultra violence and working with nice people.
Meant a week in Prague, in Feb, bj scene, old lady going ballistic if I went
there.
Apparantly my bits belong to her...
Damn.
Never been in a straight to video before!!!!
So they are currently thinking of cutting out the sex scene on my bit.
They want me as menacing though.
Which is nice.
