Your vote on Crop Idol 
By OLIVER HARVEY

WELCOME to Crop Idol – your chance to choose Britain's most out-of-this-wor=
ld corn circle. 


The intricate patterns, which some say are the work of aliens, are big news=
 again thanks to the spooky new Mel Gibson film Signs.


Nine of the best are shown on the right. You can vote for your favourite by=
 clicking on the image and dialling the number shown beneath.

Calls cost only 10p, or 12 cents from the Republic of Ireland (though it ma=
y be a bit more if you contact us from other planets).

Lines close at 6pm today. We will reveal the
winner tomorrow.


Aliens ... or hoaxers?
THE debate continues to rage over the origin of crop circles.

Many believe they are simply the work of human hoaxers — while others are c=
onvinced they are made by aliens trying to communicate with us.

Crop circle enthusiasts insist that some of the designs appear so quickly a=
nd on such a vast scale that it is impossible for humans to have made them. =


Witnesses even claim to have seen balls of light moving through the fields =
on the nights that circles appear.

Researchers have found connections between some patterns and symbols from a=
ncient religions, mathematics and even music. 

Crop circles were first spotted in Britain in the early 1970s and now appea=
r throughout the world. The weird outlines are still most common in the sout=
h of England.

Theories about their cause include whirlwinds — known to circle experts as =
plasma vortexes — earth energies from ley lines or even forces from the huma=
n mind.

In the past the circles have also been blamed on mating roe deer, hedgehogs=
, helicopters and holes in the ozone layer.

Raymond Cox, Chairman of the Centre for Crop Circle Studies, said last nigh=
t: "It's a great unsolved mystery.

"We know not all crop circles are created by humans but we cannot say for s=
ure what is making them."

Plus lots of photos
