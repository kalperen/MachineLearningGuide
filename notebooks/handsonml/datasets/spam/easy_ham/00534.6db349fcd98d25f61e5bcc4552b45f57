Not at 40,000 m. I found this article 
(http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,53928,00.html) :

"The last person to try to break the highest free fall record died in 
the attempt. In 1965, New Jersey truck driver Nick Piantanida suffered 
catastrophic equipment failure when his facemask blew out at 57,000 
feet. Lack of oxygen caused such severe brain damage that he went into a 
coma and died four months later."

And in amongst the flash at
http://www.legrandsaut.org/site_en/

you can discover that he will break the sound barrier at 35,000 m,
presumably reaching top speed somewhere above 30,000.
