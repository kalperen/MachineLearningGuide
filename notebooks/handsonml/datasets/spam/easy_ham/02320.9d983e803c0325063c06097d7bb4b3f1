Security in cyberspace is a different kettle of fish compared to many computer 
systems. Cyberspace entertainment only has to be useful to the majority of its 
users --entertaining. That means it can tolerate a small amount of vandalism 
still remain useful. This is quite unlike a system required for commerce. We 
still have a headache of course, but at least we only need to keep the system 
around 90 percent clean, rather than 99.99 percent. Of course we’ll still 
strive to stamp out corruption, but our system failure threshold is more 
achievable than one might at first assume.
