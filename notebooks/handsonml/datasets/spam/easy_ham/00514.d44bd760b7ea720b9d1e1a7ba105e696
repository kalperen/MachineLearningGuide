I haven't seen any official data on the web (the high-ranking hits are 
overrun by religious bigots), but there's some anecdotal evidence to be 
found in

	http://sunsite.berkeley.edu:2020/dynaweb/teiproj/oh/science/aidsnur2/@Generic__BookTextView/5406

(search for promiscuity). They mention 300 to 500 partners a year. 
(Anecdotally. This is not a statistic). They also mention that this was 
specific to gay males. Lesbians don't dig promiscuity in that degree.
