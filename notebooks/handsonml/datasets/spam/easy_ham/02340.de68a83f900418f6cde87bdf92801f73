As audiences become more and more sophisticated about computer graphics, 
fractal noise and procedural woodgrain textures can no longer guarantee gushing

tool for artists who want to develop complex, multilayered shaders ranging from 
highly realistic natural surfaces to animated pyrotechnics to flatshaded 
cartoon renderings.
