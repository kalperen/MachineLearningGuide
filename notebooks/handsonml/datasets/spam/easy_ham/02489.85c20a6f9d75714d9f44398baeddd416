Any chance you could bring a wire-cutters with you the next time you're 
passing through, and cut their 'net connection? 


Hang on....mini - Mini... the the ETs have seen the Mini advert and have 
decided to get revenge by invading in the form of spambots and small 
'remote' cars. These are the probes that some of the Saucerheads rattle on 
about, probes that are fired into the atmosphere from the mama-ships. 

Thanks Joe, there's an idea for a whacky blather issue here.
