Not a bad idea at all, provided we avoid Texas's mistake.  If we get 
two senators for each of Scotland, Norn Iron, Wales and England, plus 
our fair share of congressthings, we end up with the biggest voting 
block in the US legislature and for the presidency, with a political 
spectrum whose extreme right can't poke the extreme left of the 
current US one with a long, long stick.  One sudden lurch to the left 
by the US political establishment later, we own the place.

Byzantium, anyone?
