Rendering engines used in today’s game titles utilize various techniques for 
hidden surface removal (HSR), different techniques being suitable for different 
game genres. For example, action games played in closed-in locations need an 
engine allowing fast rendering of a few hundred polygons, a high frame rate, 
and a high level of details to impress players. Conversely, a game that is 
taking place outdoors requires quite a different approach. This features 
present one one technique for hidden surface removal usable in 3D engines using 
tilizing object occlusion.
