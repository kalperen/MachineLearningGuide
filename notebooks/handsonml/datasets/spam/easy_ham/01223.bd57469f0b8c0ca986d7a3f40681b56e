   Yeah, but I try to 'take it easy' on your server.  The golden rule of the internet: when you find a free resource, don't piss'em off!  :)  I really appreciate your work; you get done the things I wish I could, and I respect that.

    OK, I'll search for the ISOs on the  one remaining site that isn't hammered.  :)

    Sure: this is a linking issue, right?  Right now I'm still pure-vanilla.  I have the stock version of rpm/rpmlib/popt/etc and the recommended version of apt that you gave me.  No, wait...there's no new code getting loaded.  I don't know, either.  It's been a long day.

   The hunt continues- with a new field!  (Actually I checked there yesterday, but it's worth another shot.)

    Thanks!
