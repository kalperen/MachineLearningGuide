Turpin:
>>Do we have any statistics on the poor man's divorce from centuries past?

Eugen Leitl:
>That's easy. Divorce didn't happen.

You seem not to know what a "poor man's divorce" is.
It is an old term, from the time when divorce was
difficult, but walking was easy, and identity was
not so locked down as it is today. Not every widow
had a dead husband.

>I'm seeing lack of innovation ..

That doesn't tell us anything except what is
happening in Eugen Leitl's life. The more common
observation is that the rate of change is increasing.
Do you have any data that might persuade us that what
you see is more telling than what others see?

>gerontocracy favors gerontocracy.

I would have thought that gerontocracy favors biotech
research and plenty of young workers to pay taxes.
Note that the fertility rate doesn't result from
decisions made by the old, but by the young. If we
want more kids, we have to convince people who are
in their twenties to become parents.
