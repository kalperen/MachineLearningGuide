Ah.  Neither Ted nor I were particularly up to date.  I pulled 
down the lates from CVS and am now running with it.  I miss the 
blue ftoc lines but I'll sort that out soon, iirc Chris said 
it's a simple resource change.

Ted's code to "ketchup" made use of some of the procs that went 
away in the sequence generalization.  I've fixed it up... almost 
and it looks like this now:

proc Cabeen_Mark2CurSeen {} {
    global exmh mhProfile msg
    set results {}
    Exmh_Status "Clearing unseen up to cur..." red
    Mh_SetCur $exmh(folder) $msg(id)
    set unseen [Mh_Sequence $exmh(folder) $mhProfile(unseen-sequence) ]
    foreach elem $unseen {
         if { $elem <= $msg(id) } {
            lappend results $elem
         }
    }
    busy Seq_Del $exmh(folder) $mhProfile(unseen-sequence) $results
    Exmh_Status ok blue
}


The "almost" is because it's not updating the highlighting on 
the ftoc.  I'm too tired to go figure out how to fix that just 
now and have to move on to other stuff.  If someone wants to 
forward me a clue feel free.

Now that I've got all of Chris' sequence stuff I discovered that 
my sequences are ... cluttered.
