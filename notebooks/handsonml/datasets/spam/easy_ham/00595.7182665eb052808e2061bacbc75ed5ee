 Endeavors Technology and RSA Security Form Strategic Partnership to 
 Enhance SSL Performance in Secure, Enterprise-Scalable P2P Computing

Endeavors Technology and RSA Security combine their respective peer-to-peer Magi Enterprise 
Web collaboration and RSA BSAFE® software for SSL users to instantly extend security and improve performance
of 
desktop and corporate data sharing, and Web interaction between workgroups inside and across corporations.

Irvine (CA) and Cambridge (UK), September 12, 2002 - Secure web collaboration software leader Endeavors
Technology, Inc. today
announced a technology sharing and marketing agreement with RSA Security Inc. the most trusted name in
e-security.® This strategic
partnership is aimed at extending the security and improving the performance of the standard SSL security
protocol used by every e-based
desktop, laptop and server. 

Under the terms of the agreement, RSA Security's trusted security tools are embedded into Endeavors
Technology's award-winning Magi
Enterprise software product. The combined solution enables IT managers and users to simply extend security and
encryption to every
Magi-enabled device for the direct device-to-device sharing and interaction of corporate data and workflow
between workgroups within and
beyond the enterprise.

Secure collaboration between desktops and corporate systems calls for enterprises to build complex and costly
network infrastructures. This
combination of technologies from the two companies eliminates both overheads, and also the need for specific
security tools for each desktop
application such as Microsoft Project. With Magi's secure RSA Security-based peer environment, collaboration
can now be rapidly, easily and
securely extended across all devices and company firewalls, and workgroups can interact with colleagues,
partners and clients without concern
in compromising corporate information. This brings true Internet scaling to corporations needing to interact
highly securely with strong
encryption and authentication across firewalls.

"In these challenging times, there can be no compromise in safeguarding corporate data and knowledge," says
Bernard Hulme, chairman and
CEO of Endeavors Technology. "Embedding RSA Security encryption software into Magi products provides IT
managers with added
assurance, speed and cost savings, and a proven security net to accelerate the deployment of business-centric
peer-to-peer computing"

Endeavors Technology joins the RSA Secured® Partner Program. The program is designed to ensure complete
interoperability between
partner products and RSA Security's solutions including RSA SecurID® two-factor authentication, RSA
ClearTrust® Web access
management, RSA BSAFE® encryption and RSA Keon® digital certificate management.

The strategic partnership paves the way for Magi Enterprise to bear the RSA Secured brand on product packaging
and advertising, be listed in
RSA Secured Partner Solutions directories, and have RSA Security's out-of-the-box, certified interoperability.
It will also lead to joint
marketing and promotional activities between the two firms, mutual field sales engagement opportunities on
joint accounts, and 24x7 worldwide
business continuity support.

"Endeavors Technology is taking a leadership role by providing the highest-level of security in its enterprise
products and streamlining the
deployment process for IT managers," says Stuart Cohen, director of partner development at RSA Security. "By
combining our products,
enterprise customers have a solution that provides encryption and authentication across firewalls."

About Magi
Magi Enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms today's Web into a highly secure

by effectively transforming
unsecured, "read-only" Web networks into two-way trusted and transparent collaboration environments, through
the use of such features as
cross-firewall connections, advanced data extraction, an intuitive graphical interface, and universal name
spaces generating "follow me URLs"
for mobile professionals.
