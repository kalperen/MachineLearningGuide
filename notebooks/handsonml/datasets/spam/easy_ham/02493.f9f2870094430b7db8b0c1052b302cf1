Hi all


I have a prob when trying to install Linux (tried RedHat, Suse) on my
laptop. I can start the install but after about 2min, the whole pc just
dies.
I know it's not a Linux prob and here is what I have encountered:

I had the same problem when installing Win on it and eventually sorted it
out by disabling the infrared port. I'm guessing this might be same prob
although I'm not sure. I am very new to Linux so it's not that easy for me
to work it out. I did manage to follow the setup procedure at one stage
(using images on disks) and it cuts out either as it's trying to verify what
CD-Rom I have or just after (hence my suspicion of the infrared port again).

can anyone help ?

thanks
Gianni
