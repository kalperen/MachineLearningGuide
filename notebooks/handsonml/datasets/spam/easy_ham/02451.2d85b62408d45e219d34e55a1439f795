#1 Those of us who are envious of your success as a writer and artist
might find this a bit hard to understand.  

#2 Once, when forced to mix with a wife's associate's [French] husband
who spent most of his time blowing his horn about how he had wined and
dined and hung out with the famous and wonderful, I became
progressively more and more Jethro-like until I was using phrases like
"Heehaw y'all -- you done talked to him!?"  My counterpart never
noticed my evolutionary decline, even as hair sprouted from my
knuckles, my forehead contracted, my eyebrows merged and I started
grunting.  Fortunately, my wife intervened and I was prevented from
doing my Moonwatcher imitation with the chicken bones left from
dinner. Regression is a wonderful curative.

no truth to the rumour I scratched my armpit
