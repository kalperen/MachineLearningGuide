If it's not stateful, it wouldn't seem to be worth the effort, although I guess it might help with DDoS attacks.

Sounds snake-oilish to me, but I'm biased by lots of experience with firewalls and proxy servers, and the limitations thereof.

> DataPower delivers XML acceleration device
> By Scott Tyler Shafer
> August 27, 2002 5:46 am PT
> 
> DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed 
> specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that 
> process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes 
> the data in 
> hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater 
> performance, 
> according to company officials.
> 
> The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the 
> first in a 
> family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based 
> startup. The 
> DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology 
> called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML 
> data.
> 
> According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was 
> conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future 
> proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data 
> between two 
> businesses.
> 
> "Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure," Kelly said. 
> "The XA35 is the first of a family."
> 
> Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the 
> file size up 
> to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on 
> application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best 
> alternative.
> 
> In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount 
> importance in the world of XML.
> 
> "Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only," Kelly 
> said. "A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. 
> Firewalls are blind to XML today."
> 
> Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on 
> security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.
> 
> According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML 
> processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach 
> the company 
> itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with 
> regards to speed 
> and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to 
> creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.
> 
> "Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code," said Kelly, 
> adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly 
> said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with 
> technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that 
> he believes 
> will be mostly false.
> Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) 
> accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes 
> of a packet, 
> while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 
> 1,400 bytes 
> and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.
> 
> The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large 
> collection of 
> XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the 
> markup language 
> as they pass through the device.
> 
> The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load 
> balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and 
> will identify 
> and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.
> 
> In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an 
> application 
> co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators 
> more granular 
> control over what data is inspected and the application server itself 
> controls the device.
> 
> DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging 
> market. Startup 
> Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega 
> XPE switch in 
> May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, 
> launched with a 
> focus on content processing and acceleration.
> The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at 
> $54,995. The 
> company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in 
> field trails at a number of other enterprises.
