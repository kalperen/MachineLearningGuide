Man killed 'trying to surf' on Tube train

An investigation has been launched into the death of a passenger who tried
to "surf" on a Tube train.
The passenger, a man in his mid 20s, died in the incident at Chalk Farm
station on the Northern Line on Monday night.
Witnesses have reported seeing the man trying to hang on to the train as it
left the north London station.
There is also a suggestion that he may have been waving at friends in the
train.
The man died when he struck the wall at the beginning of the tunnel at the
end of the platform.
"We think he may have been trying to jump on to the side of the train. It's
not quite clear what happened," said a London Underground spokeswoman.
The incident was being investigated by both LU and British Transport Police,
who today described the death as "non-suspicious."
