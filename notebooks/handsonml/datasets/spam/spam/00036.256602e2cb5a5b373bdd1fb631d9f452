<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Dear 
Friend,<BR><BR>A recent survey by Nielsen/Netratings says that "The Internet 
<BR>population is rapidly approaching a 'Half a Billion' people!"<BR><BR>SO WHAT 
DOES ALL THIS MEAN TO YOU? EASY MONEY!!<BR><BR>Let's assume that every person 
has only one E-mail address...<BR>that's 500 million potential customers and 
growing!  In addition,<BR>E'mail is without question the most powerful 
method of distributing<BR>information on the face of the earth.<BR><BR>Well, I 
think you get the picture.  The numbers and potential are <BR>just 
staggering, but it gets even better...<BR><BR>Suppose I told you that you could 
start your own E-mail business<BR>today and enjoy these 
benefits:<BR><BR>     *** All Customers Pay You In 
Cash!!!<BR>     *** You Will Sell A Product Which Costs 
Nothing to Produce!<BR>     *** Your Only Overhead Is Your 
Time!<BR>     *** You Have 100s Of Millions Of Potential 
Customers!!!<BR>     *** You Get Detailed, Easy To Follow 
Startup 
Instructions!<BR><BR>          AND 
THIS IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG . . .<BR>As you read on you'll discover how 
a 'Seen on National TV' <BR>program is paying out a half million dollars, every 
4 to 5 months<BR>from your home, for an investment of only $25 US Dollars 
expense,<BR>one time.  ALL THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE . . . <BR>AND THE 
INTERNET!<BR><BR>Before you say "Bull", please read the following:<BR>This is 
the letter you have been hearing about on the news<BR>lately.  Due to the 
popularity of this letter on the Internet,<BR>a national weekly news program 
recently devoted an entire<BR>show to the investigation of this program 
described below,<BR>to see if it really can make people money.<BR><BR>The show 
also investigated whether or not the program was<BR>legal.  Their findings 
proved once and for all that there are<BR>"absolutely NO laws prohibiting the 
participation in the<BR>program and if people can follow the simple 
instructions,<BR>they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out 
of<BR>pocket cost".<BR><BR>     DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE 
OF POPULARITY<BR>     AND RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS 
ATTAINED,<BR>     IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN 
EVER!<BR><BR>***** This is what one had to say:<BR><BR>"Thanks to this 
profitable opportunity.  I was approached many<BR>times before but each 
time I passed on it.  I am so glad I<BR>finally joined just to see what one 
could expect in return<BR>for the minimal effort and money required.  To my 
asonishment,<BR>I received total $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money 
still<BR>coming 
in".<BR><BR>          Pam 
Hedland,  Fort Lee, New 
Jersey<BR>----------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Here 
is another testimonial:<BR><BR>"This program has been around for a long time but 
I never<BR>believed in it.  But one day when I received this again in 
<BR>the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it.  I followed the<BR>simple 
instructions and walaa. . . .  3 weeks later the money<BR>started to come 
in.  First month I only made $240.00 but the<BR>next 2 months after that I 
made a total of $290,000.00.<BR>So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the 
program, I <BR>have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again.<BR><BR>The 
key to success in this program is to follow the simple<BR>steps and NOT change 
anything."<BR><BR>More testimonials later but first:<BR><BR>** PRINT THIS NOW 
FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE<BR><BR>If you would like to make at least $500,000 
every 4 to 5 <BR>months easily and comfortably, please read the following . . 
.<BR>THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!<BR><BR>**FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE 
INSTRUCTIONS,<BR>    TO MAKE YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS 
<BR>    COME 
TRUE**<BR><BR>INSTRUCTIONS:<BR>-------------------<BR>***** Order all 5 reports 
shown on the list below.<BR><BR>***** For each report, send $5 US CASH, THE NAME 
& <BR>NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and<BR>YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to 
the person whose name appears<BR>ON THAT LIST next to the 
report.<BR><BR>     MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON 
YOUR<BR>     ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any 
mail<BR>     problems.<BR><BR>     
*****When you place your order, make 
sure<BR>               
you order each of the 5 reports *****<BR><BR>You will need all 5 reports so that 
you can save them on your<BR>computer and resell them.<BR><BR>YOUR TOTAL COST $5 
X 5 = $25.00<BR><BR>**********Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, 
each<BR>of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.  Save<BR>them 
on your computer so they will be accessible for you to<BR>send to the 1,000's of 
people who will order them from you.<BR>Also make a floppy of these reports and 
keep it at your desk<BR>in case something happens to your 
computer.<BR><BR>**********IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the 
people<BR>who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the <BR>list, 
in any way other than what is intructed below in steps<BR>1 through 6 or you 
will lose out on the majority of your profits.<BR>Once you understand the way 
this works, you will also see how<BR>it does not work if you change 
it.<BR><BR>Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter,<BR>it will 
NOT work!!!<BR><BR>People have tried to put their friends/relatives names 
on<BR>all five thinking they could get all the money.  But it does<BR>not 
work this way.  Believe us, we have tried to be greedy<BR>and then nothing 
happened.<BR><BR>So do not try to change anything other than what is 
instructed.<BR>Because if you do, it will not work for you.  
Remember,<BR>honesty reaps the reward!!!<BR><BR>1. After you have ordered all 5 
reports, take this <BR>advertisement and REMOVE the name and address of the 
person in<BR>REPORT # 5.  This person has made it through the cycle and is 
<BR>no doubt counting their fortune.<BR><BR>2. Move the name & address in 
REPORT #4 down to REPORT #5.<BR>3. Move the name & address in REPORT #3 down 
to REPORT #4.<BR>4. Move the name & address in REPORT #2 down to REPORT 
#3.<BR>5. Move the name & address in REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2.<BR>6. 
Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT #1 Position.<BR><BR>PLEASE MAKE 
SURE you copy every name & 
address<BR>ACCURATELY!<BR>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>Take 
this entire letter, with the modified list of names,<BR>and save it on your 
computer.  DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER<BR>CHANGES.  Save this on a disk as 
well just in case you loose<BR>any data.<BR><BR>To assist you with marketing 
your business on the Internet,<BR>the 5 reports you purchase will provide you 
with invaluable<BR>marketing information that includes:  How to send bulk 
e-mails<BR>legally, Where to find thousand of free classified ads and <BR>much, 
much more.<BR><BR>There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture 
going:<BR><BR>   METHOD #1:  SENDING BULK E-MAIL 
LEGALLY<BR>   
---------------------------------------------------------<BR>Let's say that you 
decide to start small, just to see how<BR>it goes, and we'll assume you and 
those involved send out<BR>only 5,000 emails each.  Let's also assume that 
the mailing<BR>receives only a 0.2% response (the response could be 
much<BR>better but lets just say it is only 0.2%.  Also, many 
people<BR>will send out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of<BR>only 
5,000 each).<BR><BR>Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 
e-mails.<BR>With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for Report #1.<BR>Those 
10 people resonded by sending out 5,000 e-mails each<BR>for a total of 
50,000.  Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%<BR>responded with 
orders.  That's 100 people responded and<BR>ordered Report #2.  Those 
100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails<BR>each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.  
The 0.2% response to <BR>that is 1000 orders for Report #3.<BR><BR>Thoe 1000 
people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of<BR>5 million e-mails sent 
out.  The 0.2% response to that is<BR>10,000 orders for Report #4.  
Those 10,000 people send out<BR>5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 
million)<BR>e-mails.  the 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders 
for<BR>Report #5.<BR><BR>THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = 500,000<BR>(a 
half a million).<BR><BR>     Your total income in this 
example is:<BR>     1......$50 +<BR>     
2......$500 +<BR>     3......$5,000 
+<BR>     4......$50,000 +<BR>     
5......$500,000 .................. Grand Total = 
$555,550.00<BR><BR>     NUMBERS DO NOT LIE.  GET A 
PENCIL & PAPER AND<BR>     FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE 
RESPONSES AND <BR>     NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU 
WILL<BR>     STILL MAKE A LOT OF 
MONEY!<BR>----------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>     
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10<BR>     PEOPLE 
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 PEOPLE YOU MAILED.<BR><BR>Dare to think for a moment what 
would happen if everyone,<BR>or 1/2, or even 1/5 of those people mailed 100,000 
e-mails<BR>each or more?  There are over 250 million people on the 
<BR>Internet worldwide and counting.  Believe me, many people<BR>will do 
just that, and more!<BR><BR>     METHOD #2:  PLACING 
FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET<BR>    
<BR>---------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Advertising 
on the net is very, very inexpensive and there<BR>are hundreds of FREE places to 
advertise.  Placing a lot of<BR>free ads on the internet will easily get a 
larger response.<BR>We strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add 
METHOD<BR># 2 as you go along.<BR><BR>For every $5 you receive, all you must do 
is e-mail them the <BR>Report they ordered.  That's it!  Always 
provide same day<BR>service on all orders.  This will guarantee that the 
e-mails<BR>they send out, with your name and address on it, will be<BR>prompt 
because they can not advertise until they receive 
the<BR>report.<BR><BR>     ORDER EACH REPORT BY IT NUMBER 
& NAME ONLY.<BR><BR>Note:  Always send $5 cash (US Currency) for each 
report.<BR>Checks are NOT accepted.  Make sure the cash is wrapped in<BR>at 
lease 2 sheets of paper before you put it in the envelope.<BR>On one of those 
sheets of paper, write the NUMBER and the NAME<BR>of the Report you are 
ordering, your email ADDRESS, your NAME<BR>and postal address.  Make sure 
you affix the proper 'International'<BR>Postage if ordering a report from 
outside your country.<BR><BR>     PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE

TESTIMONIALS**********<BR><BR>"My name is Mitchell.  My wife Jody and I 
live in Chicago.<BR>I am an accountant with a major US Corporation and I 
make<BR>pretty good money.  When I received this program I grumbled<BR>to 
Jody about receiving "junk mail".  I made fun of the<BR>whole thing, 
spouting my knowledge of the population and<BR>percentages involved.  I 
"knew" it wouldn't work.  Jody<BR>totally ignored my supposed intelligence 
and a few days later<BR>she jumped in with both feet.  I made merciless fun 
of her,<BR>and was ready to lay the old "I told you so" on her when<BR>the thing 
didn't work.  Well, the laugh was on me!  Within<BR>3 weeks she had 
received 50 responses.  Within the next 45<BR>days she had received a total 
of $147,200.00 all cash!<BR>I was shocked.  I have joined Jody in her 
"hobby".<BR><BR>     Mitchell Wof,  Chicago, 
Illinois<BR>----------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>"Not 
being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to<BR>make up my mind to 
participate in this plan.  But conservative<BR>that I am, I decided that 
the initial investment was so little<BR>that there was just no way that I 
wouldn't get enough orders<BR>to at least get my money back.  I was 
surprised when I found<BR>my medium sized post office box crammed with 
orders.  I made<BR>$319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks.  The nice thing 
about this<BR>deal is that it does not matter where people live.  
There<BR>simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and<BR>so 
big".<BR><BR>     Dan Sondstrom,  Alberta, 
Canada<BR>---------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>"I 
had received this program before.  I deleted it, but later<BR>I wondered if 
I should hav given it a try.  Of course, I<BR>had no idea who to contact to 
get another copy, so I had to<BR>wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else 
. . . . . . . <BR>11 months passed then it luckily came again.  I did not 
<BR>delete this one!  I made more than $490,000 on my first try<BR>and all 
the money came within 22 weeks".<BR><BR>     Susan De 
Suza,   New York, 
NY<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>"It 
really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy<BR>money with little cost 
to you.  I followed the simple<BR>instructions carefully and within 10 days 
the money started<BR>to come in.  My first month I made $20,560.00 and by 
the<BR>end of the third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.<BR>Life is 
beautiful, thanks to the Internet".<BR><BR>     Fred
