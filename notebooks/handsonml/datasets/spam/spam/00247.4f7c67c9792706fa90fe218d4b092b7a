only child of late Mr and Mrs FRANCIS. My late father
was the former financial controller of Côte d’Ivoire
telecommunication (CITELCOM). My father died due to
the heat of political crisis in my country recently
last years.But,I am motherless since,before my fathers
late and the death of my mother on 26 SEPTEMBER 1993
was as a result of spiritual attack by our family
member who hated her just because of my fathers
wealth.
Moreover, they tried their own part as well against my
father and myself but negative because God almighty
is available at our side. Infact God is wonderful.
Although, before the death of my father in one of the

specifically on family matters and mostly the safety
of his monies us$16,500,000.00 (sixteen million,five 
hundred thousand united states dollars) which he
deposited in a bank here in my county Abidjan, 
Côte d’Ivoire and used my name,MARTIN FRANCIS as the
next of kin for the deposits. This amount was accrued
from an over-invoiced contract award for the
construction of an underground telephone network to
replace the former in the new city (Yamoussoukro) and
other major cities also for installation of the
microwave station awarded to my late father,Mr JOSEPH
FRANCIS in 1999 to expatiate companies. In fact, after
the finished payment of  contract workers, my late
father deposited this fund in a bank as the full
beneficiary contractor of the said company (CITELCOM)
this is the fund I want to transferred to your account
as the beneficiary contractor due for payment,provided

you cooperate.Therefore I am seeking your full and
urgent  assistance for the telegraphic transfer of
this sixteen million and five hundred thousand united
states dollars, us$16,500.000 US dollars to your
designated account for a very good business investment
in your country as due to the instruction my father
